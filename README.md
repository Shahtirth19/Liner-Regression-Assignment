## General Information
This project involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The goal is to help BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider, understand the factors influencing bike demand.

## Conclusions
Key Factors Affecting Demand:

* Year: Bike demand increased from 2018 to 2019.
* Holiday and Working Day: Non-holidays have slightly higher bike rentals than holidays.
* Weather: Clear weather has the highest bike rentals, followed by misty weather, with light rain resulting in the lowest rentals.
* Months: Demand is lowest in January and December and peak in May to October.
* Weekends: Saturdays see more bike rentals than weekdays.
* Seasons: Spring has the lowest bike rentals.
